I will likely continue to use OneDrive for documents and things that other files that I need constant access to, but Syncthing works great for pictures and music.

One alternative that I've considered is [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/) (formely known as BTSync). BTSync works much like Syncthing but is proprietary and runs on a modified version of the Bittorent protocol. The one feature that currently sets BTSync apart is the ability to encrypt files at rest - Syncthing only encrypts files during transport. This can give you additional peace of mind if you don't fully trust one of your nodes for example. I've also heard that it's gentler on the CPU, but for my use-case Syncthing's CPU usage has not been an issue.
