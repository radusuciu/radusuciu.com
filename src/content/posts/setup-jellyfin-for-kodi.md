This short post details my Jellyfin for Kodi setup. The information that is readily found through google and in the project docs is overly complicated - at least right now.

I use Jellyfin as a media server and Kodi to play these media files over the network using the Jellyfin for Kodi addon. I have Jellyfin 10.4.3 running on Ubuntu Server 18.04 and Kodi 18.5 running on a Nvidia Shield Pro (2019).
