[daff](https://github.com/paulfitz/daff) is a super-charged `diff`. I install it using `pip install daff` but you can use pretty much any package manager (npm, cargo, etc.). Example use: compare `.csv` files, ignoring certain columns (`--ignore COLUMN_NAME`), and ignoring numerical differences with a configurable delta value (`-d 0.001`).
